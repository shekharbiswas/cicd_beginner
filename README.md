# CI/CD for Beginners

## Introduction
Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) are essential DevOps practices that help automate software development, testing, and deployment.

## Key Concepts
- **CI (Continuous Integration):** Developers frequently integrate code into a shared repository, followed by automated testing.
- **CD (Continuous Deployment/Delivery):** Automates the release process, ensuring that code changes are deployed safely.

## Benefits
- Faster software delivery
- Reduced bugs with automated testing
- Efficient collaboration among teams

## Getting Started
1. Choose a CI/CD tool (GitHub Actions, Jenkins, GitLab CI, etc.).
2. Define a pipeline in a YAML file.
3. Automate build, test, and deployment steps.

## Example CI/CD Tools
- Jenkins
- GitHub Actions
- GitLab CI/CD
- CircleCI
